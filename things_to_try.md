#  Greenbank 40ft Observing:    things to try out

1. For the example spectrum, can you zoom in a bit by looking at the signal near 0 (the baseline).

2. Compare the spectrum from the LAB and BL (the default) surveys at the same location in the sky.
   What's the most obvious difference?  How could you better compare them.

3. Plot a spectrum at the galactic center:  use the coordinate conversion plot (the last page in https://greenbankobservatory.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/40-manual.pdf) and find the RA (LST) and DEC of the galactic center.

4. Plot spectra at some selected points in (RA,DEC). Look at the (GLON,GLAT) coordinates and make a table of the peaks and velocities where the peaks occur, e.g. (I'm completely making this up)

       7 00 00 -10    210 -10      -50 10  70    (three peaks)
       8 30 00 +10    180 +10      -100 0        (two peaks)
       ...


    Some hints:
    * pick a series of points along the galactic plane (GLAT at 0)
    * pick a series of points perpendicular from the plan (GLON the same)
    * Are the points where there is no HI ?
