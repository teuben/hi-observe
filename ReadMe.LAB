Leiden/Argentine/Bonn Galactic HI Survey
========================================
2004-12-09 (final data release)

Reference:  Kalberla et al. (2005) A&A 440, 775

The Dwingeloo 25-m telescope was used for DEC > -27 deg,
the Villa Elisa 30-m telescope for DEC < -25 deg.

The beam FWHM for the 25-m telescope is 35.7 arcmin,
the beam FWHM for the 30-m telescope is 30.0 arcmin.
Regridding was by Gaussian interpolation (18 arcmin),
leading to the following effective resolution (FWHM):
40 arcmin for DEC > -27 deg, 35 arcmin for DEC < -25 deg
37.5 arcmin for -27 < DEC < -25 deg (overlap)
Note: the grid of 30 arcmin violates Nyquist sampling

Dap, Arnal, E.M., Bajaja, E., Morras, R., and  P\"oppel, W.G.L.
(2005) A&A 440, 775 describes the merger of the
northern (dec > -27) HI survey of Hartmann & Burton (1997)
made with the Dwingeloo 25-meter telescope with the
southern (dec < -25) survey of Bajaja et al. (2005)
made with the IAR 30-meter telescope, as well as refined
corrections for stray radiation possible because of the
availability of the all-sky coverage.

Depending on the region of the sky being studied, please
cite, in addition to the Kalberla et al. (2005) reference,
also the appropriate source of the material used, namely
Hartmann & Burton (1997, Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0521471117)
and/or Arnal et al. (2000), A&AS, 142, 35,
Bajaja et al. (2005, A&A 440, 767)

Observers were Dap Hartmann and W.B. Burton (Leiden University),
for the Dwingeloo telescope, and E.M. Arnal, E. Bajaja, J.J. Larrarte,
R. Morras, & W.G.L. Poeppel (Argentine Institute for Radio Astronomy),
for the Villa Elisa telescope.
